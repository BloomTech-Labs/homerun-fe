# Intro

TidyHive simplifies home management with an easy-to-use interface and a robust feature set allowing you organize everything in your home from day-to-day tasks to larger projects. 


## Key Features

-    TidyHive gives you the ability to organize and manage your todos in a simple and easy way.
-    Manage and share household todos from any device.
-    Assign todos to household members manually, automatically, or randomly.
-    DownloadTidyHive to your mobile device for use offline.
-    Time-blocking
-    When a user completes a task and swips it complete - there is animation (confetti) to emulate the feeling of crossing off a list.

# Tech Stack

## Front-end built using:

## [React](https://reactjs.org/)


-    We are able to use a "virtual browser" that is more friendly than a real browser (Virtual DOM)
-    Reusable components 

## [Redux Toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/)
-    Includes utilities to simplify common use cases like store setup, creating reducers, immutable update logic, and more. Provides good defaults for store setup out of the box, and includes the most commonly used Redux addons built-in.

## [Semantic-UI](https://react.semantic-ui.com/)
-    Includes a varity of objects and elements to incorporate into our app.

## [React-Router](https://reacttraining.com/react-router/)
-    React Router is a collection of navigational components that compose declaratively with your application.


## [OAuth](https://www.okta.com/resources/whitepaper-pre-built-identity-solution/?utm_campaign=search_google_amer_multiple_ao_ciam_exact&utm_medium=cpc&utm_source=google&utm_term=oauth&utm_page={url}&gclid=CjwKCAjw7e_0BRB7EiwAlH-goM5hGQ3CoE8czHcm1fEVW-DV78Lcn-jU4aA2l-_qhJ5utpy7u6LgPhoCrJgQAvD_BwE)

Google Sign in

-    For easy access
-    From user research, most users like to use social media as an easy and fast way to sign in quickly. 


## Front end deployed to [Heroku](www.heroku.com)

# [Back-end](https://github.com/Lambda-School-Labs/homerun-be) built using:

## [Node.JS](https://nodejs.org/en/)

-    As an asynchronous event-driven JavaScript runtime, Node.js is designed to build scalable network applications.

## [Postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/)

-    PostgreSQL is a powerful, open source object-relational database system with over 30 years of active development that has earned it a strong reputation for reliability, feature robustness, and performance.

## [Knex](https://www.npmjs.com/package/knex)
-    Knex can be built using a JavaScript build tool such as browserify or webpack. In fact, this documentation uses a webpack build which includes knex. View source on this page to see the browser build in-action (the global knex variable).

# Testing

## [Jest](https://jestjs.io/docs/en/tutorial-react)
-    Jest allows us to create mock functions with almost zero configuration and provides a really nice set of matchers that makes assertions easier to read.

## [React Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro)
-    This library encourages your applications to be more accessible and allows you to get your tests closer to using your components the way a user will, which allows your tests to give you more confidence that your application will work when a real user uses it.
